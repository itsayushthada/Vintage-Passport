Some of the typical features include pools, fountains and canals inside the gardens.\r\nSince the very beginning, the construction of gardens was a beloved imperial pastime of the Mughal Empire. Babur, the first Mughal conqueror-king, had gardens built in Lahore and Dholpur. His son, Humayun, is known to have spent lots of time at his father\'s gardens. Akbar built several gardens first in Delhi, then in Agra. These tended to be riverfront gardens rather than the fortress gardens which were built by his predecessors.
