        <p>Travelling plays an important role in our education. The terms 'travelling' and ‘education‘ cannot be alienated from each other. Our education remains incomplete without travelling."Travelling" means going from one place to other places.
		   In ancient times travelling was very difficult and risky because there were no proper roads and transports.A traveler had to pass hills and forests. He had to face the fury of nature, wild beasts, robbers and many other obstacles.
		  With triumph of science, travelling has now become easy, cheap, quick and pleasant. Due to invention of steamships railways, electricity, motor cars and airplanes, our journey from one place to and other place even in abroad has become very
		  easy and comfortable.

		Travelling is now regarded as an important part of education. Educational Tour increases our knowledge and new thoughts and ideas grow up in us. The education of man remains incomplete if he does not visit important places of the world. Reading of 
		books only provides man with half knowledge. But travelling with eyes wide open and mind fully gives him full knowledge.Travelling also removes his narrowness and superstitions. It makes a traveler smart and self-reliant. Owing to the fabulous progress
		in the field of communication, travelling today involves less hazards. Hence, students must take part in educational tours. It is both entertaining and instructing for them.
